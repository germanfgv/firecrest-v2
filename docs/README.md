# FirecREST v2

FirecREST is an open-source, lightweight REST API for accessing HPC resources developed by the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre ([CSCS](https://www.cscs.ch/)).

FirecREST presents a high performance proxy providing a standardized interface to access HPC infrastructures from the web, with authentication and authorization, supporting multiple schedulers, storages, and filesystems types.

Using FirecREST, users and web developers can **automate** access to HPC resources and create client applications, pipelines, and workflow managers on the top of HPC with a standard and secure interface.

## Features

-	🔐 Authentication and authorization layer integrating [Open ID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/)/[OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) and [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev/)
- ⚡ High-performance RESTful API powered by [asyncIO](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
-	✨ Abstracts underlying HPC technology (schedulers, filesystems, storage, etc.) relying in [REST API](https://restfulapi.net/) concept and [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification
-	📡 Async SSH connection pool enabling high-throughput regime
-	🩺 Integrated HPC cluster health checker
-	💠 Modular architecture with a lightweight and modern stack
- 💻 Easy to integrate with your code using [pyFirecREST](https://pyfirecrest.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Python library
